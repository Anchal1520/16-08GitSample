Interface: multiple inheritance is not supported in the case of class because of ambiguity.
            However, it is supported in case of an interface because there is no ambiguity.
            It is because its implementation is provided by the implementation class.
         Interface fields are public, static and final by default, and the methods are public and abstract   
            



Functional Interface- An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface. 
                      It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method
